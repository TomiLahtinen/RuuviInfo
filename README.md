# RuuviTag Info App

Just a little iOS / tvOS app to show RuuviTag info and save advertisement data to CoreData storage. This is to show how easy it is to "port" iOS apps to tvOS just by adding another UI layer. Everything else is shared

Currently only works when running in foreground so no background love this time. Also iOS side needs some UI magic to make it look nicer
